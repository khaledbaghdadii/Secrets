# Secrets


Secrets is a webpage where users can login and enter their secret (only one). Also,once logged in they can view all submitted secrets on the site without knowing for whom do they belong to.
Users can register an account through the webpage and login using it, or login using their Google accounts.

**Motivation**

This was a guided project as part of a bootcamp style summer internship that I completed last year.



**Tech/framework used**

The project was  built using Express.js for the backend part. 
Node.js was extensively used and several node modules where installed to complete this app.
One of the main node-moudules used is passport which was used to authenticize the users when they login.
Google-OAuth 2.0 was used to enable users to login through their Google accounts.
The databased used in No-SQL Database (MongoDB)
Throughout the project I was working on both the back-end and front-end technologies in addition to designing a database through MongoDB

**Built with**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Google OAuth 2.0
